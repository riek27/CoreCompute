## Features

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: Leverage thousands of idle GPUs across the globe.  
- **Multi-Framework Support**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and custom frameworks.  
- **Edge Compute**: Run AI workloads near the data source for low-latency results.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduce compute costs by up to 70% compared to traditional cloud.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track job progress, metrics, and logs in real-time.  
- **Automatic Failover**: Node failures handled automatically with checkpointing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone https://riek27.github.io/HyperAstraAI.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd HyperAstraAI
Open index.html in your browser to explore the demo.
For production deployment, follow our platform documentation for API integration and job submission.
Supported Frameworks
TensorFlow
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Custom ML frameworks (via API integration)
Workflow
Connect Your Environment: Integrate with your ML workflow using our API or web interface.
Submit Compute Job: Define resource requirements and submit jobs to the decentralized GPU network.
Monitor Progress: Track metrics, logs, and performance analytics in real-time.
Receive Results: Download trained models or inference outputs directly to your environment.
Credits System
Credits are our platform currency for accessing GPU resources.
One credit ≈ one hour on an entry-level GPU.
High-tier GPUs consume more credits per hour.
Credits never expire; volume discounts available.

I can also create a **more visually appealing version with badges, GIF demo previews, and feature icons** if you want it to look top-tier for GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
